# 🏛️ Prithvi Fix — National Cooperative Gig Services Platform
> *"Verified Skills. Fair Living Wage. Stronger Cooperative Communities."*

**Prithvi Fix** is a digital public goods platform designed to connect verified, skilled artisans belonging to regional **Labour Cooperative Societies & District Federations** with households, businesses, and government institutions.

Unlike profit-extracting private aggregators that levy high commissions (25%–35%) and treat gig workers as disposable labor with zero safety nets, **Prithvi Fix** implements an institutional cooperative model where:
1. Workers are **member-owners** in registered primary cooperative societies.
2. A statutory **93-2-5 Escrow Model** guarantees **93% direct living wage** to the artisan, **5%** into social security welfare (ESIC accident cover, Mini-PF, health fund, NSDC upskilling), and **2%** for cooperative platform upkeep.
3. Service tariffs are transparent and standardized with government-regulated base rates and **zero hidden surge pricing**.
4. Multi-district statutory governance is enforced by **District Cooperative Officers (DCOs)** under the Odisha Cooperative Societies Act across **Khordha, Cuttack, and Puri**.

## 🚀 Quick Start & Local Setup

### 1. Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v18.0 or higher) — `node -v`
- **PostgreSQL** (v14 or higher) — `psql -V`

### 2. Configure Environment Variables
Copy the example environment configuration into `backend/.env`:
```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
```
Ensure your PostgreSQL credentials in `backend/.env` are set:
```env
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development
PGHOST=localhost
PGPORT=5432
PGUSER=postgres
PGPASSWORD=your_postgres_password
PGDATABASE=prithvifix
JWT_SECRET=prithvi_fix_secure_jwt_secret_key_2026
CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173
CORS_ALLOW_ALL=true
```

### 3. Auto-Migrate & Seed the Database
Run the automated migration and seed script to provision all 12 database tables, statutory indexes, and realistic demo data:
```bash
npm run seed
```

### 4. Start the Application
Run both backend and frontend from the root workspace or in separate terminals:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Backend API (Port 5000)
npm run dev:backend

# Terminal 2: Frontend Client (Port 5173)
npm run dev:frontend
```

Open your browser at **`http://localhost:5173`**.

## 🌐 Public Sharing via ngrok

To share the working platform with stakeholders or test across mobile devices:
```bash
ngrok http 5173
```
*Vite automatically proxies `/api` requests to backend port 5000, so a single frontend tunnel exposes the entire full-stack application.*
